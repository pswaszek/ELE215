<h1>
ELE 215 - Submitting your Work
</h1>

Documentation of your work in ELE 215 is to be submitted via Brightspace.
Specifically, 
<ul>
<li> Labs 1, 2, 4, and 5 have just a single- or double-sided summary page 
	that should be uploaded as a single pdf document. 
<li> Labs 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 have a summary page(s) and additionally 
	require a graph or graphs. These graphs should be on just one separate 
	page and be included as part of the single pdf document.
<li> Lab 3 requires a MatLab program which should be uploaded as a single 
	script file.
<li> Lab 12, the Black Box, requires a brief report; format will be discussed 
	later in the semester. 
</ul>

When uploading this single document/script to the ELE 215 Brighspace site,
please use the following naming convention for your file:
<ul>
<li> In general, the name should be the concatenation of which effort it 
	represents (i.e. lab number) followed by student name(s), all separated 
	by underscores.
<li> For student names, please shorten then to 6 letters - 5 for the last name 
	(padded by x's if needed) plus the first initial, using capitals for the 
	first letter of the last name and the initial, no spaces. 
<li> For example, let's consider student Thomas MacGreggor and his effort on 
	Lab 2 (in which you each work individually). He would scan his summary 
	page to 
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lab_2_MacgrT.pdf
	<br><br>
	and submit this file via Brightspace. In a similar way, student Barbara
	Jobb would submit the file
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lab_2_JobbxB.pdf
	<br><br>
	(the extra x after Jobb extends her last name to 5 letters). 
	For Lab 3 their individual MatLab scripts would be named
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lab_3_JobbxB.m
	<br><br>
	and 
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lab_3_MacgrT.m
	<br><br>
	For joint work, say Lab 1, the single submission would be called 
	<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lab_1_JobbxB_MacgrT.pdf
	<br><br>
	putting the names in alphabetical order by last name for joint work. 
<li> Which student submits the joint work? Go with the one whose last 
	name appears first alphabetically; hence, for the above example 
	Barbara Jobb submits. 
</ul>











A few of these activities are individual, but most are for pairs of students:
<ul>
<li> Lab 2, 3, and 6 are individual work so should be submitted individually.
<li> Lab 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are intended for pairs of students (and
	I will preassign pairs, rotating you with other class mates); in these cases
	I expect to receive only one submission from each pair.
 	If for some reason your assigned lab partner is unavailable, you should work 
	alone; working in triplets or modifying my pairings will be penalized.
<li> For the final lab (12) you may work with a partner of your choice. 
</ul>

How can you generate a pdf file?
<ul>
<li> The printers at URI's library scan 
<li> Smartphone apps such as Notes for iPhones do a reasonable job; just be sure to 
	submit something that is high quality. 
</ul>
